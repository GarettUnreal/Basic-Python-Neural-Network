# Basic-Python-Neural-Network
A basic implementation of a neural network.

The test was originally supposed to be done on the digit data, however the recognition rate was poor. Assuming my implementation is correct then a basic neural network without any feature extraction of the raw data will not work efficiently. This makes sense because it seems that something known as CNN or Convolutin Neural Networks are used the perform image recognition which does perform feature extraction of the raw data before it is fed into the neural network.
